Problem Statement

Image Gallery Application


Create an image gallery using django.


The web app should contain a simple page which shows all the images uploaded.


Initially when there are no images, display a message saying upload an image.


1) A button should be present to upload the image. On clicking it we should be able to select an image category  from the drop down and choose the image from the computer and upload it.

2) After adding the image it should be visible in the gallery page. 

3) Also we should be able to filter the image based on category. Upon selecting a category, only the images of that particular categories should show. 

4) Give a button "clear filter" to clear the category filter and show all the images.
